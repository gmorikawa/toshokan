# README

This project is the API of _toshokan_ system for managing documents like books, whitepapers, etc.

## Objectives

Since I have many digital books as PDF, I wanted some way to catalog them all so I could quickly search books of a specific topic. Also, since I read in more than one device I thought it would be cool if there were some centralized place where every device at home can access for those books.

After I bought a machine to make my little home lab I decided to write this application to manage books.

## Getting Started

To execute the project run the following command:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

To install, or reinstall, dependencies using `maven` execute the following:

```bash
./mvnw install
```
